The calculator is designed for ease of use, allowing users to perform calculations interactively.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Power Calculation**: Calculate the power of a number.
- **Square Root Calculation**: Supports both real and complex square roots.
- **Logarithmic Functions**: Calculate logarithms with any base.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent of angles (in degrees).
- **Complex Number Support**: Perform basic operations (+, -, *, /) with complex numbers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear instructions and error handling for invalid inputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries: `math`, `cmath`

## Installation
